#### Contract is deployed on [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/)

## Steps for deploying on Arbitrum:

1. Install Arbitrum on local machine -> [https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/installation](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/installation).
2. Add `Arbitrum (public testnet)` network to Metamask ->  [https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet).
3. I'm using `0x65a3fE4a37Be6Df8d98e113A5c4DA8F3f8B72C44` address for testing and deployment. To see transactions, open `rinkeby-arbitrum` explorer: [https://rinkeby-explorer.arbitrum.io/](https://rinkeby-explorer.arbitrum.io/).

Right now, I am having about `19 ETH` on `Rinkeby testnet` and `0 ETH` on `Arbitrum One`

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
